### Goal   
- Understand the Dataset & cleanup   
- Build Regression models to predict the fare price of uber ride.   
- Also evaluate the models & compare thier respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.


### Findings   
- Fares per mile in NYC is affected by day, time, and number of passengers   
- Manhattan downtown, LaGuardia Airport, and John F. Kennedy International Airport are the three most rewarding places for the uber drivers   
- Uber drivers in NYC should have different strategies between weekdays and weekends   
  1. For Weekdays, uber drivers should take as many orders as possible in 12 pm. The best time during weekday,from the data, is around Thursday 12 am.   
  2. For Saturday, they should take as many orders as possible between 12:00 am to 4 am
